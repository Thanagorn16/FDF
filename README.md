# 🌄 FDF — 3D Wireframe Renderer
>A minimalist C program that transforms 3D elevation data into a 2D wireframe using isometric projection.

---

### 📌 Project Description
FDF (Fil de Fer, French for wireframe) is a graphical program that reads elevation maps and visualizes them in a 2D isometric projection. This project was developed as part of the 42 School curriculum, with the goal of mastering fundamental graphics, coordinate transformation, and low-level system programming in C.

### ✨ Features
🔹 Parse 3D elevation data from .fdf map files

🔹 Render wireframe models using isometric projection

🔹 Support interactive controls (zoom, pan, rotate, adjust elevation)

🔹 Display smooth lines using Bresenham’s algorithm

🔹 Real-time redrawing and responsive UI

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
🧠 C Language — Core language used for performance and control

🎨 MiniLibX — Lightweight graphical library for window management and drawing

📐 Bresenham's Line Algorithm — For accurate and efficient line rendering

🔲 Matrix math — To handle 3D to 2D coordinate projection

### 🚧 Challenges Faced
Implementing accurate isometric transformations manually

Drawing pixel-perfect lines and preventing graphic tearing

Ensuring responsive user controls and redraw efficiency

Handling variable map sizes and memory allocation dynamically
